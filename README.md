# Statistical-Modelling-and-Forecasting-Case-Study
This project involved analyzing multiple datasets, including BMI, Handgrip Strength, and Tesla Stock, to uncover relationships and forecast trends. By employing various statistical models, the analysis provided insights into how these factors interact and influence each other over time, allowing for informed predictions based on historical data.

# Key Components:
• Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and reliability.  
• Applied statistical analysis techniques to identify relationships within the data.  
• Developed predictive models for trend forecasting using historical data.  
• Created visualizations to effectively communicate insights and results.  

# Technologies Used:
**Language**: R  
**Libraries**: quantmod, ggplot2, xts, openxlsx, corrplot, PerformanceAnalytics, rugarch   
**Tools**: RStudio  

# Benefits:
This project not only enhanced my statistical modeling and forecasting skills but also improved my ability to visualize complex data effectively. By working with real-world datasets, I developed a deeper understanding of the interactions among various factors and gained practical experience in applying predictive modeling techniques. These skills contribute to more informed decision-making processes in data-driven environments.
